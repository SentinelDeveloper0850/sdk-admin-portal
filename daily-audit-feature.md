# Daily Audit Feature

## üìà Why the Daily Audit Feature is Needed

At Somdaka Funerals, employees collect client payments using shared speedpoint machines. Each day, they are expected to submit a **batch of their individual receipts**, while the ASSIT system records the official card transactions processed under their name.

Currently, the process of verifying whether employees‚Äô receipts **match the system totals** is done manually by Andy ‚Äî often requiring hours of comparison, calculations, and note-taking.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem

* **Manual and time-consuming**: Andy spends several hours each week reconciling transactions by hand.
* **Human error**: Risk of missing discrepancies or wrongly flagging employees.
* **No audit trail**: Past issues aren‚Äôt easily traceable or reportable.
* **No accountability**: Repeat offenders aren‚Äôt automatically tracked or flagged.
* **Lack of visibility**: Management can‚Äôt easily see who is consistently out of balance or failing to submit.

---

### ‚úÖ What the Daily Audit Feature Solves

* ‚è± **Saves time** by automating the matching of daily receipts and system balances.
* üßÆ **Calculates discrepancies** instantly and flags `Over`, `Short`, or `Balanced`.
* üíÇ **Maintains a daily audit record** per employee per day ‚Äî with receipt attachments.
* üìä **Generates weekly summaries**, highlighting issues and trends at a glance.
* üö© **Flags repeat offenders** over a rolling 30-day period, allowing proactive follow-up.
* üìÅ **Centralizes submission tracking**, making it clear who submitted, who didn‚Äôt, and when.

---

### üìà Business Impact

* ‚úÖ Improved **financial accountability**
* ‚úÖ Stronger **internal controls**
* ‚úÖ Reduced **fraud risk or negligence**
* ‚úÖ Faster **issue resolution**
* ‚úÖ Clear historical audit trail for **management review** or HR action

> In short: The Daily Audit Feature transforms a tedious, manual process into an efficient, transparent, and scalable system ‚Äî saving hours every week and improving financial integrity across the business.

## üì§ Receipt Upload Flow

### Route: `POST /api/audit/upload-receipts`

* **Auth Required**: Yes (Employee)
* **Inputs**:

  * `file`: Image file (jpg/png/pdf) containing receipts
  * `date`: Date the receipts are for
* **Logic**:

  1. Store file in Cloudinary
  2. Run OCR on uploaded image

     * Ignore `Settlement Summary`
     * Extract all `Total` amounts
  3. Sum totals ‚Üí `batchReceiptTotal`
  4. Create or update `DailyAudit` entry for `(employeeId, date)`

     * Store attachment URL
     * Store total
     * Set `submissionStatus: Submitted`
  5. Run auto-match if `systemBalance` exists:

     * Compute `discrepancy`
     * Set `status`

---

## üì• System Balance Upload (Andy)

### Route: `POST /api/audit/upload-system-balance`

* **Auth Required**: Yes (Andy)
* **Inputs**:

  * `.xls` file from ASSIT for the day
* **Logic**:

  1. Parse file to extract: `{ employeeName, balance }` per row
  2. Match against users by name
  3. For each:

     * Find or create `DailyAudit` for `(userId, date)`
     * Store `systemBalance`
     * Compute discrepancy if batch receipts already exist
     * Set `status`

---

## üßæ Status Computation Rules

```ts
if (!batchReceiptTotal && !systemBalance) {
  status = "Nothing to Submit";
  submissionStatus = "Nothing to Submit";
} else if (batchReceiptTotal && !systemBalance) {
  status = "Awaiting System Balance";
  submissionStatus = "Submitted";
} else if (!batchReceiptTotal && systemBalance) {
  status = "Missing Batch Receipt";
  submissionStatus = "Not Submitted";
} else {
  discrepancy = batchReceiptTotal - systemBalance;
  if (discrepancy === 0) status = "Balanced";
  else if (discrepancy > 0) status = "Over";
  else status = "Short";
}
```

---

## üìä Weekly Summary

### Route: `GET /api/audit/summary?week=2025-07-21`

* **Auth Required**: Yes (Andy/Admin)
* **Output**:

  * `totalStaffAudited`
  * `fullyBalanced`
  * `discrepanciesFound`
  * `nonSubmissions`
  * `highRiskDiscrepancies` (|discrepancy| > R2000)
  * `repeatOffenders` (‚â• 3 discrepancies or non-submissions in past 30 days)

---

## üîß Configuration

```ts
{
  HIGH_RISK_THRESHOLD: 2000,
  REPEAT_OFFENDER_WINDOW_DAYS: 30
}
```

## üñºÔ∏è UI Integration

* Integrate in SDK Admin Portal
* **Upload Receipts Drawer**: For employees
* **Reconciliation Table**: For Andy (with editable fields)
* **Weekly Summary Page**: Table + Matching Summary + Notes section
